# Lexique Sound Flashcard Generator For Anki
> Generates Anki import-able flashcards from the French Lexique 3.83.


## Installation

Just download and run the python files in order of file names.

You'll probably have to configure the Lexique input file and preferred output locations.

## Release History

Most all work was done prior to release. I'll look at pushing fixes if people actually use this and report issues.

Everything is fully functional as of Ubuntu 24.04.1.
